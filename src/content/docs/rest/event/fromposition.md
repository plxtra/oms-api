### Query Parameters

| Parameter     | Expected | Description |

| to            | Optional | An ISO8601 date and time. The most recent timestamp to return (inclusive). If omitted, defaults to now. |
| count         | Optional | An integer. The maximum number of records to return. If omitted, returns every record. |
| for           | Optional | The [SubscriptionType](../../../proto/oms2/#subscriptiontype) to return events for. Repeat for additional views. If omitted, supplies events for all views. |
| owner         | Optional | The Owner ID to return events for. Repeat for additional owners. If omitted, returns all owners. |
