Choose the API that's right for you.

## Command Line Tools

Use the [command line tooling](./cli/) for quick and easy administrative tasks, scripting, and scheduled tasks.

## REST API

If the command line tooling isn't enough, you can exercise the [REST API](./rest/) directly from your preferred programming environment.

## WebSocket API

For realtime streaming of OMS events, or to submit realtime updates directly into OMS, utilise the [WebSocket API](./ws/).
